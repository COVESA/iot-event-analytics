  - Fix rule evaluation for Function Talents by adding excludeOn option for AND/OR rules.<br>
    Whenever a talent listened to function outputs (_callees()_ returns a non-empty array), the function output rule remained being evaluated to true once a single function response was successfully received. Talent output rules and (optional) trigger rules (returned by _getRules_ or _get\_rules_) were joined by an OR rule. Now any non-function event, belonging to a feature, which was defined in the trigger rules made the whole ruleset evaluate to true, no matter if the trigger rules were matched or not.
    - JSON API is now at 2.0.0
  - Homogenize usage of _getRules_, _get\_rules()_, _onEvent_ and _on\_event_ throughout Talents and Function Talents<br>
    Use the given functions no matter, if you are subclassing a Talent or a Function Talent
  - Remove dapr adapter example, since it's implementation is deprecated
  - Add bugfixes for Visual Studio Code Extension
    - Fix wrong evaluation of docker-compose build number
