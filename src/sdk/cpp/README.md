# IoT Event Analytics C++ SDK

To build the library, just create a build directory and configure/build with CMake.
This will automatically fetch the required dependencies (i.e. the Paho MQTT client).

1. `mkdir build`
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..`
4. `make`

## Examples

Example usage of the library can be found under /examples
